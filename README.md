A self-hosted dashboard that turns Technitium DNS into a household-grade
parental control system for parents and home-labbers who want real visibility
and real control of the devices on their LAN — including the modern ones that
actively try to bypass your DNS server.

## Status

> [!WARNING]
> **Guardium DNS is in very early development.** It is a personal homelab
> project shared publicly so other parents and home-labbers can use it,
> learn from it, and contribute. APIs, schemas, and UI will change without
> notice. There is no upgrade path between versions yet. **Use at your own
> risk on your own network.**

This project exists because the author wanted a sane way to:

- protect his kids from things they shouldn't see online,
- enforce reasonable screen-time and category-based rules,
- and actually *win* the cat-and-mouse game against smart TVs, consoles and
  phones that ignore DHCP-provided DNS or use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to bypass
  filtering entirely.

If that resonates with you, you're in the right place.

## Hardware & router compatibility

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The author has tested Guardium DNS end-to-end on exactly one router: an
> ASUS RT-BE88U on stock firmware.** Everything else is theoretical. Routers
> from the same family (AsusWRT, Asuswrt-Merlin) are *expected* to work
> because they share the underlying NVRAM keys, but this hasn't been
> verified yet — please report back if you try one.

For routers from any other vendor (UniFi, OpenWrt, EdgeOS, MikroTik,
TP-Link, Netgear, ISP-supplied boxes, etc.), the **DNS-only** layer of
Guardium still works fine — that's where most of the value lives. The
optional **router integration stages** (MAC kill switch, DNS Director, DoH
IP blocklist) are vendor-specific and will need a new adapter module per
firmware family.

If you want a vendor adapter and you're comfortable poking at your own
router, [open an issue](../../issues/new) describing the model and
firmware. Adding a new vendor is realistically a **community effort**: the
author needs direct (or remote, shell-access) cooperation from someone
who owns the device, because each firmware exposes a different API surface
(NVRAM keys, HTTP endpoints, SSH commands, iptables modules) and there's
no way to develop or test a vendor adapter blind. PRs and "here's what my
router's admin UI looks like" screenshots are welcome.

## What it does

### For parents

- **Per-device profiles** with sensible defaults: `unrestricted`, `default`,
  `kids`, `no-streaming`, `no-gaming`, `no-youtube`, `internet-off`.
- **Per-person rules** — group devices under a household member ("Hudson",
  "Alex") and apply a single profile across all their devices.
- **Schedules** — bedtime, school hours, "homework mode". A profile change
  can apply on a recurring schedule (e.g. block all streaming Mon–Fri
  17:00–19:00).
- **Quotas** — daily caps per category or per app (e.g. 1 hour of YouTube
  per day, after which the category gets sinkholed).
- **One-click family pause** — kill the internet for everyone except the
  adults' devices, instantly.

### For home-labbers

- **Live visibility** into who's online, what they're querying, what's
  blocked, and at what rate.
- **MAC-anchored device tracking** — profiles follow a device across DHCP IP
  changes automatically.
- **Device fingerprinting** — every device gets a vendor (from MAC OUI) and
  a device-type hint (e.g. "Samsung Smart TV", "Apple device", "NVIDIA
  Shield") inferred from DNS query patterns. Helps you identify the rando
  `192.168.4.140` showing up in your logs.
- **Router integration (optional, three stages)** — push enforcement into
  your ASUS router for devices that ignore or bypass DNS-based blocking.
- **Idempotent reconciler** — every 60 seconds, dashboard state is
  reconciled against Technitium and (if configured) your router. Nothing is
  one-shot; everything self-heals.
- **Zero-Technitium-modification** — Guardium talks to Technitium only over
  its HTTP API. We never patch Technitium's binaries, configs on disk, or
  systemd unit. Technitium upgrades cannot break Guardium, and removing
  Guardium leaves Technitium untouched.

```

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / Uvicorn, single process under
  `dns-dashboard.service`.
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js + Chart.js, no build step (CDN).
- **Storage**: SQLite at `/var/lib/dns-dashboard/dashboard.db`.
- **Port**: `8080` (Technitium itself stays on `5380`).
- **Auth**: reuses Technitium admin credentials. The login form proxies to
  Technitium's `/api/user/login`; the token comes back, gets stored in an
  HTTP-only cookie, and Guardium uses it on every backend call.

### Profiles → Technitium Advanced Blocking groups

Profiles are not invented by Guardium — they map 1:1 onto **groups in the
Technitium [Advanced Blocking](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/blob/master/Apps/AdvancedBlockingApp/README.md) app**.
On every dashboard start, Guardium re-asserts these seven managed groups
in Technitium, populated with the blocklist URLs and domain lists from
`server/profiles.py`:

| Profile | Block list URLs | Explicit domain blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `unrestricted` | — | — |
| `default` | StevenBlack `hosts` (ads + trackers) | DoH bootstrap domains |
| `kids` | StevenBlack + porn-only + social-only + gambling-only + fakenews-only | DoH bootstrap + 12 YouTube domains |
| `no-youtube` | StevenBlack | DoH bootstrap + 12 YouTube domains |
| `no-streaming` | StevenBlack | DoH bootstrap + YouTube + 22 streaming domains (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Twitch, Spotify, TikTok, Stan, Binge, Kayo, 9now, 10play, 7plus, iview, SBS) |
| `no-gaming` | StevenBlack | DoH bootstrap + 30 gaming domains (Steam, Epic, Fortnite, Xbox Live, PSN, Nintendo, Roblox, Minecraft, EA, Battle.net, Riot, Ubisoft, Discord) |
| `internet-off` | — | DoH bootstrap + a `.*` regex (matches every query) |

The **"DoH bootstrap"** set is the 25 hostnames clients use to *discover*
encrypted-DNS providers (`dns.google`, `cloudflare-dns.com`,
`mask.icloud.com`, `dns.nextdns.io`, `dns.quad9.net`, `doh.opendns.com`,
`dns.adguard.com`, `doh.mullvad.net`, etc.). Blocking them at the DNS
layer prevents iOS Private Relay, Chrome's secure DNS, Firefox's DoH,
Android Private DNS, and Microsoft's Office private resolver from
*activating* — which forces those clients to fall back to Technitium,
where the rest of the profile takes effect.

Blocks are answered with **`0.0.0.0` / `::`** (a sinkhole) rather than
NXDOMAIN. NXDOMAIN lets DoH clients silently retry a secondary resolver
and lets some smart-TV/IoT devices fall back to hardcoded public DNS;
returning a non-routable IP looks like a successful resolution and keeps
the client stuck on you.

A catch-all `0.0.0.0/0` (and `[::]/0`) is mapped to the `default` group,
so any device you haven't explicitly assigned a profile to still gets
sane ad/tracker blocking out of the box.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Technitium and it will survive every reconcile.

### MAC-anchored device tracking

Technitium identifies devices by IP. That's a problem when your kid's phone
reboots and DHCP hands it a new lease — suddenly the `kids` profile is on
the *old* IP and the phone is unfiltered.

Guardium fixes this by tracking every device by **MAC address**:

1. The reconciler pulls the live client list from the router on every tick
   (`ip ↔ mac`).
2. If a known MAC has moved to a new IP, the device row in SQLite is
   atomically migrated to the new IP, carrying its label, profile,
   schedules, quotas, daily usage, person-membership, and favourite status.
3. Technitium's per-IP `networkGroupMap` is updated in the same pass; stale
   entries for the old IP are removed.

The result: profiles "stick" to devices across reboots and lease churn, no
manual intervention.

### Device fingerprinting

For every device, Guardium derives two hints:

1. **Vendor** — looked up from the MAC OUI against the
   [IEEE OUI registry](https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.csv) (cached
   offline on first run, with Wireshark `manuf` mirrors as a fallback).
2. **Device-type hint** — a hand-curated rule set (`server/fingerprint.py`)
   scans the device's recent DNS queries against ~100 known domain
   patterns. Tier-1 specific (`shield.nvidia.com` → "NVIDIA Shield"),
   tier-2 vendor-only (`samsungelectronics.com` → "Samsung device"),
   tier-3 weak hint (`apple.com` → "Apple device").

Both run automatically in the background (≤5 devices/min), and you can
force-refresh a single device with the in-row identify button. Helps
enormously when a device shows up with a randomized MAC and no hostname.

### Router integration — three stages

DNS-level blocking is great. It is also **trivially bypassed** by any device
that hard-codes its own DNS (lots of smart TVs do) or uses DNS-over-HTTPS
(every modern phone, Chromecast, Google TV, Amazon Echo, etc.). Guardium
includes optional router integration to close those holes.

> [!NOTE]
> Router integration is **optional** but **strongly recommended** for
> households with smart TVs, gaming consoles, or any device you don't fully
> trust. Currently supports **ASUS routers** (RT-BE88U-class hardware
> verified; should work on any AsusWRT/Merlin device with the same NVRAM
> keys).

Router credentials (IP, username, password, optional SSH key) are stored
encrypted at rest using a Fernet key generated on first boot. Everything
the dashboard adds to your router is tagged or kept in a dedicated chain so
it can be cleanly removed without touching the rules you've added by hand.

#### Stage 1 — MAC-based "internet off" (HTTP)

Uses the router's built-in **MAC filter** feature (`MULTIFILTER_*` NVRAM
keys) to block specified MAC addresses at the firewall level. When a
device is on the `internet-off` profile, its MAC is added to the router's
block list; the device cannot send *any* IP traffic, not just DNS.

- **Defeats:** every form of DNS bypass (the device can't route at all).
- **Survives router reboot:** yes (NVRAM-persistent).
- **Requires:** HTTP admin access to the router. SSH not needed.

#### Stage 2 — DNS Director per MAC (HTTP)

Uses **DNS Director** (`dnsfilter_*` NVRAM keys) to transparently rewrite
every port-53 packet from a specific MAC to point at Technitium, even if
the device hard-codes `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`. Devices on any profile other
than `unrestricted` get steered into the dashboard's filter automatically.

- **Defeats:** hard-coded plain-DNS (UDP/TCP port 53) bypass.
- **Survives router reboot:** yes (NVRAM-persistent).
- **Requires:** HTTP admin access. SSH not needed.

#### Stage 3 — DoH IP blocklist (SSH + iptables/ipset)

This is the one that beat the TCL Google TV.

> #### The Google TV story
>
> Several Google-branded smart TVs (TCL, Sony, Hisense Google TVs;
> Chromecast with Google TV) **silently fall back to DNS-over-HTTPS
> against `dns.google` and `dns64.dns.google`** when their configured DNS
> can't satisfy them. They make outbound HTTPS to `8.8.8.8:443` /
> `8.8.4.4:443` and bypass everything in the DNS layer — including DoH
> hostname sinkholing, because they use the IP directly.
>
> Stage 3 fixes this by SSHing into the router (Dropbear) and:
>
> 1. creating an `ipset` (`dnsdash_doh`) populated with the IPv4/IPv6
>    addresses of known DoH endpoints (Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, NextDNS,
>    AdGuard, Mullvad, etc.),
> 2. installing iptables rules in a dedicated chain (`DNSDASH_DOH`) that
>    drop outbound TCP/443 (and TCP/853 for DoT) to any IP in the set,
>    scoped to the MACs of devices on a restricted profile.
>
> Result: the Google TVs queries `dns.google` for an `A` record, succeeds
> (because the DNS resolution itself isn't blocked), opens a TCP/443 to
> `8.8.8.8`, and the router silently drops the SYN. The TV falls back to
> the configured DNS — which is now Technitium, which now blocks YouTube
> for the `no-youtube` profile. Mission accomplished.

- **Defeats:** DNS-over-HTTPS bypass to known providers.
- **Survives router reboot:** rules need to be re-applied (the reconciler
  does this on every tick, so it's transparent).
- **Requires:** SSH access to the router with `iptables` + `ipset` + the
  `xt_set` kernel module. The dashboard probes for this on first run and
  reports back if the firmware doesn't have what it needs.

## What works without router integration

You can run Guardium with **zero router setup** and get a lot of value. The
table below shows what each layer can and can't do.

| Capability | DNS-only | + Stage 1 | + Stage 2 | + Stage 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Ad/tracker blocking on cooperative devices | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Per-profile category blocking (kids, no-streaming, …) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Schedules, quotas, family pause | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Block `internet-off` device that ignores DHCP DNS | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Block device that hard-codes `8.8.8.8` plain DNS | ❌ | partial¹ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Block device that uses DoH (`dns.google` etc.) | ❌ | ✅² | ❌ | ✅ |
| Block device that uses DoT (port 853) | ❌ | ✅² | ❌ | ✅ |
| Block VPN bypass (Mullvad, NordVPN, …) | ❌ | ✅² | ❌ | partial³ |

¹ Stage 1 turns the device off entirely, so technically yes — but only as
"internet off", not selective.
² Stage 1 just kills all traffic, so it trivially blocks anything.
³ Stage 3 blocks well-known VPN provider IPs but it is a moving target.

**TL;DR**: DNS-only is fine for laptops, phones, Apple TVs, and any device
that respects DHCP. For smart TVs, game consoles, and anything Google-y,
enable Stage 2 and Stage 3.

---

## Requirements

- A Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu tested) with:
  - **Technitium DNS Server** installed and reachable on
    `http://127.0.0.1:5380`, with the **Advanced Blocking** app enabled,
  - Python 3.11+ and `python3-venv`.
- A permanent Technitium API token (the install script will prompt or
  accept one via `DASHBOARD_BOOT_TOKEN`).
- **Optional but recommended:** an ASUS router (AsusWRT or
  Merlin/Asuswrt-Merlin) with admin access. Stage 3 additionally needs SSH
  access and `iptables` + `ipset` (`xt_set`).

---

## Install

There are two pieces to a Guardium DNS deployment:

1. A **Technitium DNS server** somewhere on your LAN (the actual resolver).
2. The **Guardium dashboard** service, which usually lives on the same host
   as Technitium and talks to it over `127.0.0.1:5380`.

You also need a way to make the devices on your network *use* Technitium for
DNS — that's a one-time change on your home router.

### Reference deployment (what the author runs)

This is the exact setup the project is developed and tested on. Mileage
will vary with other distributions, hypervisors, and routers; this is the
known-good path.

- **Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE.
- **Technitium DNS:** Debian 13 LXC container, installed via the brilliant
  [community-scripts.org](https://community-scripts.org/scripts/technitiumdns)
  Proxmox helper script (see Step 1).
- **Guardium dashboard:** installed *inside the same LXC* alongside
  Technitium, by `rsync`-ing this repo and running `deploy/install.sh`.
- **Router:** ASUS RT-BE88U on stock firmware, with LAN DHCP pointing every
  client at the Technitium LXC IP.

If you don't have Proxmox, anything that gives you a Linux host with
network reach to your LAN will do — a Raspberry Pi, a NUC, an Ubuntu VM in
your cloud of choice over a VPN, etc. The Guardium installer assumes a
modern Debian/Ubuntu environment with `apt`.

### Step 1 — Install Technitium DNS

If you already have a working Technitium server, **skip to Step 2**.

The author's recommended path on Proxmox is the
[community-scripts.org Technitium DNS helper](https://community-scripts.org/scripts/technitiumdns).
On your Proxmox VE node's shell, run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/technitiumdns.sh)"
```

Accept the defaults (Debian 13, 1 CPU, 512 MB RAM, 2 GB disk) or bump them
if you want bigger query log retention. When it finishes, write down the
LXC's IP address — you'll point your router at it shortly.

> The helper script comes from the community-driven
> [Proxmox VE Scripts](https://community-scripts.org/) project (built in
> memory of [tteck](https://github.com/tteck)). Huge thanks to them.

Verify Technitium is reachable:

```bash
curl -s http://<LXC-IP>:5380/ | head -1
```

You should get an HTML response. If not, check `pct list` on the Proxmox
host and `pct start <id>` if the container isn't running.

### Step 2 — Enable the Advanced Blocking app

Guardium maps profiles 1:1 onto groups inside Technitium's **Advanced
Blocking** app, so the app needs to be installed.

1. Open the Technitium web UI: `http://<LXC-IP>:5380/`.
2. Create your admin user when prompted.
3. Go to **Apps**, click **Browse Store**, find **Advanced Blocking**, and
   click **Install**.
4. Once installed, click its **Config** button to open it at least once —
   this creates the empty `groups` / `networkGroupMap` structures that
   Guardium will populate on first launch.

### Step 3 — Get a Technitium permanent API token

Guardium uses a permanent service token for the one-time bootstrap (after
that, the UI uses your regular Technitium login credentials over an
HttpOnly cookie).

In the Technitium UI:

1. Click your username (top-right) → **Create API Token**.
2. Name it something obvious like `guardium-bootstrap`.
3. Copy the token — it is shown exactly once.

### Step 4 — Install Guardium DNS

From a workstation that can SSH to your Technitium host (in the reference
setup, the Proxmox LXC):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adzza/guardium-dns.git
cd guardium-dns
BOOT_TOKEN="<paste-the-token-from-step-3>" ./deploy.sh root@<LXC-IP>
```

`deploy.sh` rsyncs the project to `/opt/dns-dashboard/` on the remote and
runs `deploy/install.sh`, which:

1. installs Python + venv tooling if missing,
2. creates a dedicated `dns-dashboard` system user,
3. owns `/opt/dns-dashboard` and `/var/lib/dns-dashboard`,
4. builds a venv and installs Python deps,
5. writes `/etc/dns-dashboard.env` (only on first install, including your
   bootstrap token),
6. installs and starts the `dns-dashboard.service` systemd unit.

When it finishes you'll see:

```
==> done. Dashboard URL:  http://<LXC-IP>:8080/
```

Open that URL, sign in with the same admin user you created in Technitium,
and you're in.

#### What the install does to Technitium

The first time the dashboard starts with a valid service token, it
**writes a complete Advanced Blocking app config to Technitium** —
nothing in the Technitium UI needs to be touched by hand. Specifically:

- Creates (or overwrites) the seven managed groups: `unrestricted`,
  `default`, `kids`, `no-youtube`, `no-streaming`, `no-gaming`,
  `internet-off`. Each group is populated with the appropriate
  StevenBlack blocklist URLs and the curated domain lists from
  `server/profiles.py`.
- Maps `0.0.0.0/0` and `[::]/0` to the `default` group so every device
  on your LAN gets ad/tracker blocking by default, even before you've
  assigned anything explicitly.
- Sets `enableBlocking=true`, `blockingAnswerTtl=30s`, and
  `blockListUrlUpdateIntervalHours=24` (Technitium re-downloads the
  StevenBlack feeds on its own daily schedule).
- Sets the sinkhole address to `0.0.0.0`/`::` rather than NXDOMAIN, to
  defeat DoH-fallback and IoT NXDOMAIN-fallback bypass tricks.
- Auto-installs the **Query Logs (Sqlite)** Technitium app if it isn't
  already present, so the dashboard's per-device query history works
  out of the box.

This same routine re-runs on every dashboard restart, which is what
keeps managed groups consistent (and what makes manual UI edits to those
seven groups not stick — see the warning in *Profiles → Technitium
Advanced Blocking groups* above).

Block-list URLs are *registered* by Guardium; the actual hosts files are
fetched by Technitium itself on its 24-hour schedule. Right after the
install the URLs are wired up but the file contents may not be cached
yet. If you want the lists active immediately, open the Advanced
Blocking app in Technitium and click **Update Now**, or wait up to a
day.

#### Manual install (no rsync)

If you'd rather not push from a workstation:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/adzza/guardium-dns.git /opt/dns-dashboard
sudo DASHBOARD_BOOT_TOKEN=<token> bash /opt/dns-dashboard/deploy/install.sh
```

### Step 5 — Point your router's DHCP at Technitium

Until your router hands out the Technitium IP as the network's DNS, nothing
on your LAN is actually using it.

**On ASUS routers (AsusWRT or Merlin):**

1. Sign in to your router's admin UI (usually `http://router.asus.com/` or
   `http://192.168.1.1/`).
2. Go to **LAN** → **DHCP Server**.
3. Set **DNS Server 1** to your Technitium LXC's IP.
4. Leave **DNS Server 2** **blank** if you want hard guarantees that every
   client uses Technitium. If you set a public fallback like `1.1.1.1`,
   clients are free to pick that one and all your filtering goes out the
   window.
5. Set **Advertise router's IP in addition to user-specified DNS** to
   **No**.
6. Click **Apply**.
7. Reboot any device on your LAN (or wait for its DHCP lease to renew) so
   it picks up the new DNS setting.

**On other routers:** the exact menu name varies, but you're looking for
the DHCP server's DNS option — sometimes called "Custom DNS", "DNS Server
override", or just "DNS Servers". The principle is identical: primary =
your Technitium IP, secondary = empty (or another internal resolver, but
never a public one if you want enforcement).

### Step 6 (optional) — Enable router integration

If you're on an ASUS router and have devices that bypass DNS (smart TVs,
Google TVs, consoles), open the dashboard's **Settings → Router** page and
fill in:

- Router IP, username, password.
- (Optional) SSH credentials for Stage 3 (DoH IP blocklist).

Click **Test connection**, then toggle the stages you want and **Apply**.
The reconciler will push the rules to the router on the next 60-second
tick and self-heal them on every tick after that. Toggling a stage off
triggers a clean teardown of all rules the dashboard added — your manual
router config is never touched.

## Configuration

Everything tunable lives in `/etc/dns-dashboard.env` (read at service
start). Defaults are picked for a single-host deployment alongside
Technitium.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TECHNITIUM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:5380` | Technitium HTTP API base URL. |
| `TECHNITIUM_SERVICE_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Permanent service token for boot-time setup (one-time; UI logins take over afterwards). |
| `DASHBOARD_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address. |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | `8080` | Listen port. |
| `DASHBOARD_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/dns-dashboard` | SQLite + Fernet key location. |
| `DASHBOARD_WEB_DIR` | `/opt/dns-dashboard/web` | Static asset directory. |
| `LAN_DNS_RESOLVERS` | *(auto)* | Override LAN gateway used for PTR lookups (defaults to system default route). |

Router credentials are **not** stored in the env file; they go through the
**Settings → Router** UI and are encrypted at rest with a Fernet key
generated on first boot at `/var/lib/dns-dashboard/secret.key`.

---

## Security model

- **Authentication.** Guardium has no user database of its own. The login
  form forwards your credentials to Technitium's `/api/user/login`. The
  returned token is stored in a `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie.
- **At-rest secrets.** Router passwords (and any other future secrets) are
  encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) using a key held in
  mode-0600 `/var/lib/dns-dashboard/secret.key`. Plain text never lives in
  the database, in logs, or on the wire to the browser.
- **In-transit.** Guardium currently listens on plain HTTP on `:8080`.
  Put it behind a reverse proxy (Caddy/Traefik/nginx) with TLS if you
  expose it beyond your LAN. There is no plan to bundle TLS termination.
- **No outbound calls** other than:
  - the local Technitium API,
  - the configured LAN gateway (PTR lookups),
  - your router (HTTP/SSH, only if configured),
  - a one-time IEEE/Wireshark OUI download cached to disk.
- **Router rules are tagged.** Everything we add to the router lives in
  named NVRAM list entries (Stages 1–2) or a dedicated iptables chain
  (`DNSDASH_DOH`, Stage 3). Disabling a stage in the UI triggers an
  automatic teardown on the next reconciler tick. Your manual router
  rules are never touched.

---

## Limitations and known issues

- **Single router vendor.** Only ASUS is implemented today. Adding
  OpenWrt/EdgeOS/UniFi is on the roadmap; PRs welcome.
- **DoH/DoT cellular bypass.** Stage 3 blocks DoH/DoT at the *home
  router*. A phone on cellular obviously isn't on your router and
  cannot be filtered. There is no software fix for this; it's a property
  of the device leaving your network.
- **DNS-over-HTTPS rotation.** Stage 3 ships a curated DoH IP list. New
  providers and new IP ranges appear constantly. The list is updated by
  hand for now.
- **No HA/clustering.** Single process, single SQLite file, single host.
  This is a household tool, not a service.
- **No automated upgrades or migrations** yet. Backups are your problem.
  Schema changes between commits may require deleting `dashboard.db`.
- **Per-IP, not per-user.** Two people sharing a laptop share a profile.
  "People" grouping helps but it's still device-scoped underneath.
- **TLS termination not bundled.** Put it behind a reverse proxy if you
  care.

## Contributing

This is a one-person hobby project at the moment, but contributions are
welcome — especially:

- **Router adapters** for non-ASUS firmware,
- **Fingerprinting rules** for devices you've identified on your own
  network,
- **Bug reports** with reproduction steps, environment details, and
  reconciler logs (`journalctl -u dns-dashboard -n 200`).

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue first so we can talk about
the approach before you spend time on a PR.
